		<p>I am a graphic designer who has been involved in a wide variety of work over my career; everything from posters to tee shirts, wedding stationary to business cards, icon design to UI layout, and logos to complete branding.
			<br><br>
			What started as a hobby quickly turned into work. I have been working in and around graphic design for more than 7 years. I am the son of a graphic designer and classically trained musician, and because of this, I have developed a passion for any and all things creative. Photography, music, video editing, website building, fine art, furniture design; you name it, I have tried it. 
			<br><br>
			I married a wonderful woman a little over a year and a half ago, and in my spare time, you can find me playing guitar, spending time with my family, or rewatching every glorious second of Breaking Bad.</p> </div>
