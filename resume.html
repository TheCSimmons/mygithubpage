 		<h1>about me</h1>
 		<p>I’m a graphic designer who has been involved in a wide variety of work over my career; everything from posters to tee shirts, wedding invitations to business cards, and <br>logos to complete branding . What started as a hobby quickly turned into income as I started freelance work.I’ve been working in and around graphic design for 7+ years. I’m the son of a graphic designer and a classically trained musician, and because of this, I’ve developed a passion for anything creative. I married a wonderful woman a little over a year and a half ago, and in my spare time, you can find me playing guitar, or attempting photography, or trying to build a new piece of furniture for my home.<p>
